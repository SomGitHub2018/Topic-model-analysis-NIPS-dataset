We intend to build a model to find abstract topics from unlabeled document collection. In this growing age of digital data, labelling documents/data by human is not feasible. Automatic topic analysis is the key to organize huge amount of unstructured semantic data. Topic model analysis helps companies or organizations find structure in data and organize based on discovered topics and suggest customers only that relates to his interests or usage patterns. Weve chosen NIPS dataset, which is a collection of all papers from NIPS Machine learning conference between 1987-2015. Once we find topics in series of documents, we intend to predict how
topics evolved over time. This gives us information on how subjects have been discussed and when new topics began taking shape among scientific community. We would also predict evolution of topics over time.
